## Introduction
- not indifferentiable from a random oracle
- random oracle: math model of ideal hash function
- input x ∈ X to h, h(x) is equivalent to random response chosen uniformly from y

## Proof

## When does forward map and reverse map not exist?
![map existence](./images/svw/map.jpg)
todo: insert remaining calculations


## Why is it indifferentiable?

## Exponentiation?
